# Kickstarter-analysis
Perform kickstarter analysis
# Kickstarting with Excel
This analysis is performed through Excel
## Overview of Project
This project provides detailed analysis on how different categories such as movies, plays, musics, etc, and their goals, and their results. Showing what is the relationship of these two sets of data by using line graphs. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the relationship between the goals of different categories such as movies and plays and the outcomes. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge would be how to find the right data for the graph, and setting the correct filters. Also another challenge would be the functions such as: COUNTIFS, and setting the right ranges and also the right conditions, otherwise, the number would show incorrectly. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
https://github.com/LingZ1993/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png  Based on the line chart created above, we can see that the successful rate is the highest during May, and then begins to decrease until hits lowest point on December. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
https://github.com/LingZ1993/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png   Based on the line chart created above, we can see that it's more easy to achieve the goal when they set the goals lower, when the goal is less than 1000, the success percentage is at its highest which is nearly 80%, and then when the goal is between 45000 and 49999, the percentage of failing is at its highest, which is 100%. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Like I mentioned above, the main difficulties are about finding the right data, and putting the correct funtion syntax. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Successful outcomes rates are at highest during May, and eventually decreases and hit lowest point on December; And failed rate is at its highest during October. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
While the overall trend is when you set goals lower the easier for them to achieve their goal, but between 30000 to 40000, the percentage successful rate goes up; When they set their goal unrealistically high like between 45000 to 49999, the fail percentage rate is 100% and successful rate is a whopping 0%. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The country list is kind of short, it would be better if this dataset contains more countries, that would makes this analysis more comprehensive. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can also make a table showing different countries comparing with each other, like different countries successful and failing rates, how much money are they setting their goals and their completion rate, etc.
